# Contributing

This project aims to showcase a minimal project to start developing for out-of-tree LLVM projects. I am trying to focus on the most recent release of LLVM.

If you know of a better way to implement something that appears here, then please open a pull request (if the change is small) or an issue (if the change is larger and you want to know whether it would be accepted first).

Any bug fixes due to CMake or compatibility are appreciated.

## Getting started

Helpful notes for developers can be found in the [`HACKING.md`](HACKING.md) document.

In addition to the above, if you use the presets file as instructed, then you should NOT check it into source control, just as the CMake documentation suggests.
